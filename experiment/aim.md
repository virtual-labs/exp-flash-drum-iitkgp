## Aim of experiment


<p style="padding-bottom: 10px;">Distillation is a unit operation or a physical separation process of separate more volatile components from a mixture by partial vaporisation of the liquid mixture followed by condensation. The distribution of the components in the two phases is governed by the vapour liquid equilibrium relationship.<br>The most elementary form of simple distillation is Flash Distillation, in which a feed mixture is partially vaporized to produce vapour which is enriched with more volatile components and a liquid that is devoid of volatile components. The vapour and liquid streams leaving the drum are in equilibrium. This operation is called equilibrium flash vaporisation or flash distillation.</p>
